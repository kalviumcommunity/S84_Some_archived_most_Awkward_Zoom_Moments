### Project Title:  Some archived most Awkward Zoom Moments 

**Project Overview**:

In this project, users can share, rate, and explore the funniest and most awkward Zoom moments we’ve all experienced. Think of those times someone forgot to unmute themselves, a pet wandered across the camera, or someone had an epic background fail. Users can upload their own Zoom mishaps (via video or funny descriptions), rate other moments based on how cringe-worthy they are, and browse through moments grouped by categories like “Worst Virtual Backgrounds” or “Most Embarrassing Mutes.” Each user will have their own profile to manage and track their favorite moments.

The app will also have a leaderboard to highlight the top-rated moments of the week and a “Random Zoom Moment” button for a little surprise each time you click it. In short, it's a collection of Zoom fails that keeps on giving!.

**Key Features: **

Users can log in to keep track of their own Zoom moments.
You can submit your funniest (or most embarrassing) Zoom moments with videos or funny descriptions.
Rate other people’s moments (how awkward was it on a scale of 1-5?).
Search for specific types of awkward moments, like "cat interruptions" or "muted disasters."
Your own personalized feed of awkward Zoom moments that match your taste.
"Zoom Moment of the Week" leaderboard – the most popular (or cringiest) moments get featured.
A "Random Awkward Zoom Moment" button for endless entertainment.
Fun trivia on the weirdest Zoom moments (like the best virtual background fails).

**Tech Stack:**

Frontend: React (with Vite to set it up quickly), Tailwind CSS for easy styling

Backend: Express.js for creating the API
Database: MongoDB to store the moments and user data

Authentication: Session-based login so users can save their moments

Deployment: GitHub Pages for the frontend, Heroku or Render for the backend

Optional: Firebase for sign-in, Docker for easy deployment.

**Why This Project:**

I chose this project because Zoom is something most people are familiar with, and there have been so many hilarious and awkward moments shared online. This project will be a fun way to practice everything I need to learn—user accounts, handling videos/images, and creating a personalized app. It's a lighthearted project that will help me build key skills while also making people laugh!
